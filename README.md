This is a very experimental attempt to make a score writer with a vim/kakoune style interface.

In the unlikely event that you want to try to run it you will need the imv image viewer for the prototype UI. You will also need the verovio engraving library installed in /usr/local/share. And maybe other things. But given that, `cargo run` should work. You're on your own for figuring out the controls.
